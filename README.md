# M04-Lab---HashSet

I wasn't sure how this was supposed to be uploaded so I just uploaded all the file and folder structures like we've been doing for the zip files previously for the homework and labs.  

This Repo contains both the Lab and the Homework since it's all in the one java project folder we've been using all semester.


The main files that I worked on were:

Module-4-Lab-HW/com/olympic/cis143/m04/student/tacotruck/set/OrdersSetImpl.java

Module-4-Lab-HW/com/olympic/cis143/m04/student/homework/tacotruckmap/impl/OrdersMapImpl.java

per the instructions on the labs and the homework.
